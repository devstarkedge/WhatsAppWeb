# TODO: Fix 401 Unauthorized on /api/auth/me Endpoint

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Add logging to backend/middleware/auth.js to log token presence and validation attempts for debugging.
- [x] Adjust cookie settings in backend/controllers/authController.js: change sameSite from 'strict' to 'lax' to allow cross-domain cookie sending in production.
- [x] Verify CORS settings in backend/server.js (ensure FRONTEND_URL is set correctly in production environment).
- [ ] Deploy changes to Render and test the endpoint after logging in via the frontend.
- [ ] Check Render logs for new logging output to diagnose any remaining issues.
